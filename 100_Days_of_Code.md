## #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020, the year of the rat so should I be studying go(pher) instead then?

### Day 1: January 05

**Today's Progress**: Continued to followed a youtube tutorial by Mosh for an introduction to Python 3. Learnt about string. Side note, also set up git repo and created ssh key to allow for seamless connection, woop üò∏

**Thoughts:** Python is an interesting language, it has quirks different to Javascript. Strange at first but I could learn to love it ü§ì

### Day 2: January 06

**Today's Progress**: It's late but I wanna continue what I started! Finally got onto conditionals, and damn how is else if elif in python?! I'm trying not to let the quirks put me off, but I keep accidentally declaring variables with let and then realise I don't need to with python!

**Aims:** Need to shake off javascript habits haha üòÜ

### Day 3: January 07

**Today's Progress**: Need to stop doing these so late at night but its the only time I can concentrate. Holy shiz finally got to doing some conditionals with operators. Discovered yet more Python üêç quirks, the biggest being that Javascript `&&`, `||` and `!!` is `and`, `or` and `not` in Python. I have now followed at least 1hr of Mosh's tutorial, would have done more but got distracted by themeing VSCode üòÖ

### Day 4: January 08

**Today's Progress**: Just a couple of games with Mosh, trying to figure out an answer befoer I see his solution and I usually get like 80% there but just a couple of points I miss. Alls good

### Day 5: January 09

**Today's Progress**: Pushing now cause we're strapped for time and I want to get my git activity chart green. Finished the car excerise, got to itterators which aren't really the most exciting part of code but they're important. Tried to make it fun by using Gwen Stefani and Harijuku girl references, pretty proud of my `harijuku_girls` itterator üòÜ. Right now, I am attempting to go through an excerise that Mosh gave but the instructions weren't clear to me...I am sure I can crack this üòû

### Day 6: January 10

**Today's Progress**: It appears in python for ranges ('e.g. [x:n]), that last numeral is the cut off point and it is not included in the result, so its like n-1. Tried a number duplicate removal exercise and my answer was totally different from Mosh's, his was more succinct. But I suppose thats the beauty of code. Also got introduced to tupples and that python has an equivalent to deconstruction called unpackaging!

### Day 7: January 11

**Today's Progress**: Got introduced to dictionaries, they're basically a lot like javascript object so they weren't too difficult. Got different methods but I can again see similarities

### Day 8: January 13

**Today's Progress**: Finally got to the money, FUNCTIONS! I can now organise my code into reusable blocks üò∏ Learnt the difference between a parameter and an argument; parameter is the placeholder and the argument is the supplied value when the function is called.

### Day 9: January 14

**Today's Progress**: Not a fan of classes in Javascript and so it was interesting to see them in Python. They are again also very similar and I found the whole class extension thing you can do really cool, I wonder if you can do the same in Javascript? Also learnt about modules which allows you to abstract code so its not all on one page.

I've decided that once I finish Mosh's tutorial series on Python, I'm gonna reward myself and buy a Raspberry Pi (after some research of course) and try and do some projects with it. So far I am just over 50% through the video tutorial üíÉ

### Day 10: January 16

**Today's Progress**: I'll admit today was hard and one of _those_ days, not very interesting topics...packages and modules. Actually I didn't understand Mosh's explaination (he depended on pycharm functionality to create a package...why not show us how to make a package mainly?! ffs) nor did I see the point of setting up things as package. I think they're like npm packages? Skipped!
