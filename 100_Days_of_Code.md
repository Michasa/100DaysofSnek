## #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: January 05. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to followed a youtube tutorial by Mosh for an introduction to Python 3. Learnt about string. Side note, also set up git repo and created ssh key to allow for seamless connection, woop ðŸ˜¸

**Thoughts:** Python is an interesting language, it has quirks different to Javascript. Strange at first but I could learn to love it ðŸ¤“

### Day 2: January 06. Monday

**Today's Progress**: It's late but I wanna continue what I started! Finally got onto conditionals, and damn how is else if elif in python?! I'm trying not to let the quirks put me off, but I keep accidentally declaring variables with let and then realise I don't need to with python!

**Aims:** Need to shake off javascript habits haha ðŸ˜†
