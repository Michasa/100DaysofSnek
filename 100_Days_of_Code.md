## #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: January 05. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to followed a youtube tutorial by Mosh for an introduction to Python 3. Learnt about string. Side note, also set up git repo and created ssh key to allow for seamless connection, woop 😸

**Thoughts:** Python is an interesting language, it has quirks different to Javascript. Strange at first but I could learn to love it 🤓

### Day 2: January 06. Monday

**Today's Progress**: It's late but I wanna continue what I started! Finally got onto conditionals, and damn how is else if elif in python?! I'm trying not to let the quirks put me off, but I keep accidentally declaring variables with let and then realise I don't need to with python!

**Aims:** Need to shake off javascript habits haha 😆

### Day 3: January 07. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Need to stop doing these so late at night but its the only time I can concentrate. Holy shiz finally got to doing some conditionals with operators. Discovered yet more Python 🐍 quirks, the biggest being that Javascript `&&`, `||` and `!!` is `and`, `or` and `not` in Python. I have now followed at least 1hr of Mosh's tutorial, would have done more but got distracted by themeing VSCode 😅
